## Code Quiz Assignment

My task for this assignment was to a build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

I utilized html, css, javascript and git to complete this homework assignment.
